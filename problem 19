Q:The set of intelligent students in a class is
(a) A null set
(b) A singleton set
(c) A finite set
(d) Not a well-defined collection
Ans:
A set is considered well-defined if it is possible to determine with certainty whether an object belongs to the set or not. Let's evaluate the options given:

(a) A null set: This would imply that there are no intelligent students in the class, which is a very specific and generally unlikely condition.

(b) A singleton set: This would imply that there is exactly one intelligent student in the class, which is also a very specific condition.

(c) A finite set: This implies that there are a limited number of intelligent students in the class, which is a reasonable assumption.

(d) Not a well-defined collection: This would imply that the set is not well-defined, meaning the criteria for being considered "intelligent" are not clear or consistent, making it impossible to determine with certainty whether a student belongs to the set.

Since intelligence is often a subjective measure and can vary depending on the criteria used to assess it, the set of intelligent students in a class might not be well-defined. Without a clear, objective, and universally accepted definition of what constitutes an "intelligent" student, it would be difficult to definitively categorize students into this set.

Therefore, the most accurate choice is:

(d) Not a well-defined collection
