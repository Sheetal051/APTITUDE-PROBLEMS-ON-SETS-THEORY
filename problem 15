Q:Convert the A= {3,-3}into set-builder form
a. A= {x:x is a positive integer and is a divisor of 19}
b. A= {x:x is an integer and x^2-9=0}
c. A= {x:x is an integer and x+1=1}
d. None of these
Ans:
The correct answer is b. A= {x:x is an integer and x^2-9=0}.

The set A = {3, -3} can be written in set-builder form as:

A = {x: x is an integer and x^2 - 9 = 0}

This is because the equation x^2 - 9 = 0 has solutions x = 3 and x = -3, which are the elements of the set A.

The other options do not match the set A = {3, -3}:

a. A = {x: x is a positive integer and is a divisor of 19} would include only positive integers that divide 19, which is not the case for A = {3, -3}.

c. A = {x: x is an integer and x + 1 = 1} would imply x = 0, which is not an element of A = {3, -3}.
