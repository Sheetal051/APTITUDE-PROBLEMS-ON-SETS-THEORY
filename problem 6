Q:In a group of 75 students,12 like only cabbage,15 like only cauliflower,21 like only carrot,12 like both carrot and cabbage,13 like only capsicum and 2 like both capsicum and 2 like both capsicum and cauliflower. What is the percentage of students that do not like cabbage?
A. 16
B. 32
C.24
D. 68
Ans:
Given:

Total number of students: 75
Students who like only cabbage: 12
Students who like only cauliflower: 15
Students who like only carrot: 21
Students who like both carrot and cabbage: 12
Students who like only capsicum: 13
Students who like both capsicum and cauliflower: 2

From the problem, we need to identify all the students who like cabbage. These include:

Students who like only cabbage: 12
Students who like both carrot and cabbage: 12
Adding these, the total number of students who like cabbage is:
12+12=24

Now, to find the number of students who do not like cabbage, we subtract the number of students who like cabbage from the total number of students:
75−24=51

Next, we calculate the percentage of students who do not like cabbage:
(51 / 75) × 100 = 68%

Therefore, the percentage of students that do not like cabbage is:
68
