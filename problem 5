Q:In the given Venn diagram, A denotes mangoes, B denotes bananas, C denotes apples, and the numbers in each section represent the number of persons who like those fruits. How many persons like only bananas?
A.38
B.7
C.31
D.33
Ans:
In the given Venn diagram, the circles represent different fruits, and the numbers in each section represent the number of people who like those specific combinations of fruits.

A (mangoes) contains sections: 21, 2, 6, and 5.
B (bananas) contains sections: 31, 2, 5, and 6.
C (apples) contains sections: 14, 6, 5, and 2.

To find the number of people who like only bananas, we look at the section labeled 

B (bananas) that does not overlap with A (mangoes) or C (apples). This section is represented by the number 31.

Therefore, the number of persons who like only bananas is: 31
