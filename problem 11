Q:Select the Venn diagram that best illustrates the relationship between the following classes. Graduates, Teachers, Literates
A.A
B.B
C.C
D.D
Ans:
To determine which Venn diagram best illustrates the relationship between Graduates, Teachers, and Literates, we need to analyze how these classes overlap:

Literates: This group includes all people who can read and write.
Graduates: This is a subset of literates because all graduates must be literate.
Teachers: Most teachers are also graduates, and they are certainly literate.
Based on this understanding:

All Graduates are Literates.
All Teachers are Literates.
Some Literates are neither Graduates nor Teachers.
There can be some overlap between Graduates and Teachers (some Graduates are Teachers).
The Venn diagram that best represents this relationship is one where:

The largest circle represents Literates.
Two smaller circles inside the Literates circle represent Graduates and Teachers, with some overlap between these two circles.
Given the diagrams provided, Diagram C best illustrates this relationship:

The largest circle represents Literates.
The two overlapping circles inside represent Graduates and Teachers, showing that both groups are subsets of Literates and that there is some overlap between Graduates and Teachers.
So, the correct answer is:
C. C
