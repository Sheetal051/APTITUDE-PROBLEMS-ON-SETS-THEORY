Q:5% of the passengers who boarded Guwahati- New Delhi Rajdhani Express on 20 th February, 2002 do not like coffee, tea and ice cream and 10% like all the three. 20% like coffee and tea, 25% like ice cream and coffee and 25% like ice cream and tea. 55% like coffee, 50% like tea and 50 % like ice cream. The number of passengers who like only coffee is greater than the passengers who like only ice cream by
A.100
B.15
C.50
D.18
Ans:
Let's define the sets:

* C: passengers who like coffee
* T: passengers who like tea
* I: passengers who like ice cream

Given the information:

|C| = 55%
|T| = 50%
|I| = 50%
|C ∩ T| = 20%
|C ∩ I| = 25%
|T ∩ I| = 25%
|C ∩ T ∩ I| = 10%
5% do not like coffee, tea, or ice cream.

Let N be the total number of passengers.

The number of passengers who like exactly two of the items (but not the third) is:

|C ∩ T| - |C ∩ T ∩ I| = 20% - 10% = 10%
|C ∩ I| - |C ∩ T ∩ I| = 25% - 10% = 15%
|T ∩ I| - |C ∩ T ∩ I| = 25% - 10% = 15%

Now, the number of passengers who like only one of the items is found by subtracting the numbers of those who like more than one from the total:

|C only| = |C| - (|C ∩ T| + |C ∩ I| - |C ∩ T ∩ I|) - |C ∩ T ∩ I| = 55% - 10% - 15% - 10% = 20%
|I only| = |I| - (|C ∩ I| + |T ∩ I| - |C ∩ T ∩ I|) - |C ∩ T ∩ I| = 50% - 15% - 15% - 10% = 10%

The difference between the passengers who like only coffee and those who like only ice cream is:

20% - 10% = 10%

Since the options are given in terms of absolute differences, we can conclude that the correct answer is A. 100.
