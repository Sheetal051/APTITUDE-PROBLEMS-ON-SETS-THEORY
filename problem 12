Q:Find the solution set of the equation x^2+x+2=0 in roster form
a. {1,-2}
b. { }
c. {1,1}
d. {1}
Ans:
The equation x² + x + 2 = 0 has no real solutions. This is because the quadratic formula would give us:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = 2. Plugging these values in, we get:

x = (-(1) ± √((1)² - 4(1)(2))) / 2(1) x = (-1 ± √(-7)) / 2

Since the square root of a negative number is an imaginary number, this equation has no real solutions. Therefore, the solution set is the empty set, {}.
